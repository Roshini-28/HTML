        This is one cat that doesn’t need any help getting down from a tree. The
        leopard is so comfortable up there that it often stalks prey and even
        hauls its kills up into the branches. hauls its kills up into the
        branches.Leopards are powerful big cats closely related to lions,
        tigers, and jaguars. They live in sub-Saharan Africa, northeast Africa,
        Central Asia, India, and China. However, many of their populations are
        endangered, especially outside of Africa. You can identify most leopards
        by their light color and distinctive dark spots. Those spots are called
        rosettes, because they resemble the shape of a rose. These patterns
        camouflage their bodies as they move through the grass and trees. Black
        leopards, which appear to be almost solid in color because their spots
        are hard to distinguish, are commonly called black panthers. Unlike
        lions, leopards are solitary creatures. Males are almost entirely
        solitary and females only break their solitude when they are raising
        cubs. But, like lions, leopards roar. Male leopards defend their
        territory by roaring and scent marking, while females use their roar to
        attract mates and call their cubs. A leopard roar is a rough rasp, like
        a handsaw cutting wood.Leopard cubs are born with barely visible spots.
        The mother hides her cubs and moves them from one safe location to the
        next until they are old enough to begin playing and learning to hunt.
        When the cubs are about two years old, they live on their own. But the
        maternal bonds are strong, and offspring sometimes have reunions with
        their mothers.People usually think of leopards in the savannas of Africa
        but in the Russian Far East, a rare subspecies has adapted to life in
        the temperate forests that make up the northern-most part of the
        species’ range. Similar to other leopards, the Amur leopard can run at
        speeds of up to 37 miles per hour. This incredible animal has been
        reported to leap more than 19 feet horizontally and up to 10 feet
        vertically. The Amur leopard is solitary. Nimble-footed and strong, it
        carries and hides unfinished kills so that they are not taken by other
        predators. It has been reported that some males stay with females after
        mating, and may even help with rearing the young. Several males
        sometimes follow and fight over a female. They live for 10-15 years, and
        in captivity up to 20 years. The Amur leopard is also known as the Far
        East leopard, the Manchurian leopard or the Korean leopard.
