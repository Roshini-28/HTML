        Zebras are equids, members of the horse family. They have excellent
        hearing and eyesight and can run at speeds of up to 35 miles per hour
        (56 kilometers per hour). They also have a powerful kick that can cause
        serious injury to a predator, like a lion, a hyena, or an African wild
        dog. Usually the lead male of the herd, called a stallion, sounds the
        alarm if danger is spotted and stays at the back of the group to defend
        against predators if necessary, while the mares (females) and foals
        (youngsters) run away. Zebras often trot when moving to new pastures,
        which is a fairly fast but easy gait for them to use over the long
        distances they may have to travel. Their hard hooves are designed to
        withstand the impact of their body weight and to run easily over rocky
        ground. When resting at night, zebras lie down while one stands watch to
        prevent an ambush.Zebras are generally thought to have white coats with
        black (sometimes brown) stripes. That's because if you look at most
        zebras, the stripes end on their belly and toward the inside of the
        legs, and the rest is all white. However (there had to be a catch,
        right?), some zebras are born with genetic variations that make them all
        black with white stripes, or mostly dark with the striped pattern on
        just part of their coats. And as it turns out, zebras have black skin
        underneath their hair. So it depends on how you look at it!They serve as
        a kind of protection from predators! When zebras are grouped together,
        their combined stripes make it hard for a lion or leopard to pick out
        one zebra to chase. Zebra stripes are unique to each individual, and
        researchers in the wilderness have used zebras’ individual stripe
        patterns for identification. It might seem like a zebra is a zebra, but
        there are three different species: plains, mountain, and Grevy’s zebras.
        Different zebra species have different types of stripes, from narrow to
        wide. In fact, the farther south on the African plains you travel, the
        farther apart the stripes on the zebras get! The basic form of zebras—a
        large head, sturdy neck, long legs, a dorsal stripe along the spine and
        down a tasseled tail, and bristly mane—is universal. No zebra, or other
        wild equid, has a forelock. The Grevy’s zebra is the largest, weighing
        from 770 to 990 pounds (350 to 450 kilograms) and measuring up to 5 feet
        (1.5 meters) at the shoulder. Its thick neck and large, round ears give
        the Grevy’s zebra the most mule-like physique. The Grevy’s zebra also
        has the thinnest stripes, extending all the way down to their white
        belly; on the hindquarters the stripes are vertical until above the hind
        legs. A mountain zebra has vertical stripes on the neck and torso, which
        graduate to wider—and fewer—horizontal bars on the haunches. It has a
        gridiron pattern on the rump, and its white underside has a dark stripe
        that runs the length of the belly. A mountain zebra also has a
        distinctive dewlap on the throat that looks a bit like an Adam’s apple.
        The plains zebra is the most abundant and the smallest of the three
        zebra species. Some subspecies have a stripe pattern different from all
        others: brownish “shadow” stripes between the black stripes on their
        coat.
