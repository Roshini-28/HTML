        Giraffes are the tallest land animals. A giraffe could look into a
        second-story window without even having to stand on its tiptoes! A
        giraffe's 6-foot (1.8-meter) neck weighs about 600 pounds (272
        kilograms). The legs of a giraffe are also 6 feet (1.8 meters) long. The
        back legs look shorter than the front legs, but they are about the same
        length. A giraffe's heart is 2 feet (0.6 meters) long and weighs about
        25 pounds (11 kilograms), and its lungs can hold 12 gallons (55 liters)
        of air! Its closest relative is the okapi. Giraffes have a small hump on
        their back and have a spotted pattern similar to that of a leopard. For
        a long time people called the giraffe a “camel-leopard,” because they
        believed that it was a combination of a camel and a leopard. That's
        where the giraffe's name camelopardalis comes from! Although a study of
        giraffe genetics published in the scientific journal Current Biology
        concluded that there are actually four distinct species of giraffes—said
        to be as different from each other as polar bears are from brown
        bears—one is currently recognized, with nine subspecies. The subspecies
        have different coat patterns and live in different parts of Africa.
        Giraffe coat colors vary from light tan to practically black. The
        differences occur due to what the giraffes eat and where they live. Each
        individual giraffe’s markings are as individual as our fingerprints.
        Masai giraffes, from Kenya, have patterns that look like oak leaves.
        Uganda or Rothschild's giraffes sport large, brown splotches separated
        by thick, beige lines. The reticulated giraffe, found only in northern
        Kenya, has a dark coat with a seeming web of narrow white lines. How
        many bones are there in a giraffe's neck? Just like humans, giraffes
        have seven neck vertebrae. For giraffes, however, each one can be over
        10 inches (25.4 centimeters) long! Both male and female giraffes have
        two distinct, hair-covered horns called ossicones. Male giraffes use
        their horns to spar, throwing their neck against each other. As a male
        matures, calcium deposits begin to form on his skull to protect it when
        he head-butts with other males. These calcifications can be quite
        pronounced, giving the strange appearance of a three- to five-horned
        giraffe. Giraffes are so big that they really don't need to hide from
        predators. There is safety in numbers! It’s hard to pick out one giraffe
        from another when they form a tight group. Besides humans, only lions
        and crocodiles hunt them. If they have to, giraffes defend themselves
        with a deadly kick, karate-style. Their speed, the way they move, and
        their body designs also help them to escape predators if they need to.
        Giraffes have a way of moving, or gait, in which both the front and back
        legs on one side move forward together, then the other two legs on the
        other side move forward. It’s called "pacing." Giraffes can run very
        fast—around 35 miles (56 kilometers) per hour for short distances. You
        might think watching out for lions and spending 16 to 20 hours a day
        eating would all weigh heavily on a giraffe. Surprisingly enough,
        giraffes only need 5 to 30 minutes of sleep in a 24-hour period! They
        often achieve that in quick naps that may last only a minute or two at a
        time. Giraffes can rest while standing, but they sometimes also lie down
        with their head resting on their rump. That’s a vulnerable position for
        a giraffe, though, so usually one herd member stays on guard. Many
        people think that giraffes have no voice, but they do make a variety of
        sounds, including moos, roars, snorts, hisses, and grunts. They just
        very rarely do so. One sound giraffes make when they’re alarmed is a
        snort. Threats—such as lions nearby—may warrant a snort. Giraffes are
        often the early warning signal for other savanna wildlife: if a giraffe
        herd starts to run, everyone else does, too! Studies suggest giraffes
        vocalize below the level of human hearing and perhaps use this sound for
        long-distance communication. It’s easy to understand why giraffes top
        the list of so many people’s favorite wildlife.
